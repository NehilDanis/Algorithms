     In this assignment we are expected to accomplish constrained shortest path system. This means that we have to find shortest path depends on the must pass nodes. Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm was used in this project. But some of the details of dijkstra was changed because , we have to find the shortest path depends on some constraints. 
     First all the nodes and their edges was read from through input.txt and then the graph was created. Here in this algorithm , the program found the accurate shortest path by using normal Dijkstra. The start point and the end point of path is given us through input.txt file. The start point and the end point have to be in graph. If there is an edge that is end point is not available in graph, the edge won't be added to the system. After adding all nodes and edges, the program will find the normal shortest path. Depending on the property of Dijkstra each node has a destination weight and in the first time these values assign as positive infinity. However the start point of path will be assigned as 0.0 through the execution of dijkstra's normal shortest method. But in constrained shortest path, first I got the all must passes and then I found the permutation of these must passes. And all the edges that was discovered assigned as relax. After start point we can use n! different way to reach end point.(If there are n must pass, the result of permutation will be n!) Each result of permutation executed sequentely. Start from the start point that is given we have to find the shortest paths again and again. 
     If there were two must passes and these were 3 and 9. And if the start point was one and the and point was 12;
1 - 3 - 9 - 12
1 - 9 - 3 - 12	
     We can discover the shortest path by using these two way ,beacuse there are two must pass ,2!=2 different way to choose.
First we will start from 1 and execute the Dijkstra , and then we have to assign all values as very first status except the next value(here in first case the next value is 3).And then the Dijkstra wil be executed again. All these steps will be followed until reaching 12 and this will be implemented for each way that we can choose .By using this way we can discover the constrained shortest path.
     If there is no way to reach end node pass through must passes , the program will given error message to the output.txt as "There is no proper constrained shortest path.". Or if there is no normal shortest path from start point to the end point the program will give and error message to the output.txt as "There is no proper shortest path.". 

     Here in this assignment I got the Dijkstra's algorithm from the slides of lecture BBM202. And then I adapted it to the my own algorithm.And also I got some help for writing permutation algorithm. I got the main algorithm of permutation and then I adapted it to my own code.
